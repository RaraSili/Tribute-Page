      <p>" I guess I knew this would happen to you</p>
      <p>Inside I did, but I refused to know the truth</p>
      <p>I'm headin' back inside to sit at home with you</p>
      <p>I think I know what's wrong</p>
      <p>My friends put on their bravest face</p>
      <p>Their tails between their legs, something's out of place</p>
      <p>I bet their mothers let them know what I'm about to face</p>
      <p>Keep your mouth zipped, son</p>
      <p>Baby, I've been there before</p>
      <p>I was at the point where all I really wanted was someone</p>
      <p>And now I'm still hangin' on</p>
      <p>I was at the end of every tether waitin' for what once was</p>
      <p>Tell me all the important stuff</p>
      <p>What's your favorite color, what makes you so tough?</p>
      <p>Ple  ase don't let go when you've had enough</p>
      <p>I'm on my knees</p>
